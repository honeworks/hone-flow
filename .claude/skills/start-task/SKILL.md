name: start-task
description: Start any new piece of work (feature, fix, docs, refactor) on its own branch and decide whether it needs a change record. Use as soon as the maintainer asks for a change, before editing any file.

# Start a task

1. `git status`. If there are uncommitted changes that don't belong to this task, stop and ask the
   maintainer what to do with them.
2. `git switch main && git pull --ff-only`.
3. `git switch -c <type>/<short-slug>`. The type is a Conventional Commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
   `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`). Example: `feat/ftp-storage`.
4. Classify the task:
   - **Design change**: it changes the public API, the CLI, a guarantee in `design/current.md` §7, the run
     format (`docs/run-format.md`), the records (`docs/records.md`), a port, or adds an extra or a
     dependency. Next: `plan-change`.
   - **Small change**: a fix that restores documented behaviour, docs, tests, a refactor. Next:
     `implement-change`; a judgment call goes into `design/decisions.md`.
5. Tell the maintainer in one or two lines: the branch, the classification, the next step.

The whole flow is in `CLAUDE.md`.
